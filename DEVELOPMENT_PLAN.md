## Phase 7: Testing and Validation (Days 16-19)

- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Create integration tests for APIs
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing
- [ ] Test performance and scalability
- [x] Validate error handling and recovery
- [ ] Test across different company types and sizes

## Phase 8: Azure VM Deployment (Days 19-21)

- [ ] Set up Azure VM with appropriate specs
- [ ] Install Docker and dependencies on VM
- [ ] Configure networking and security
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS with Let's Encrypt
- [x] Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
- [x] Deploy application with docker-compose
- [x] Set up monitoring and logging

## Phase 9: Documentation and Handover (Days 21-22)

- [x] Create API documentation
- [x] Document deployment procedures
- [x] Create user guides
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [x] Document maintenance procedures
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide

## Phase 10: Launch and Initial Support (Days 22-25)

- [ ] Perform final testing in production environment
- [ ] Monitor initial usage and performance
- [ ] Address any issues or bottlenecks
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments
- [ ] Provide support during initial launch

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Implementation Features

1. **Enhanced Company Context**: 
   - Now extracts company information (industry, size, description, specialties) using ProxyCurl
   - Uses this context to improve GPT-4 search strategies

2. **Optimized Search Strategies**:
   - GPT-4 generates industry-specific, context-aware search queries
   - Customized for each company-country combination

3. **Precise Filtering**:
   - Filters by experience: 6-10+ years for current employees, 10+ years for past employees
   - Filters by seniority level: partner, director, manager, CXO, owner, VP
   - For past employees: ensures they left within last 5 years

4. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Implements asynchronous processing for search and enrichment
   - Configurable worker pools to control concurrency

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
   - Detailed logging throughout the system

### Remaining Tasks

1. **Testing**: Need to implement unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
2. **Production Deployment**: Need to deploy to Azure VM
3. **Launch Support**: Need to perform final testing and provide support

The core functionality of the system is complete and working as expected. Testing and deployment are the main remaining tasks.
